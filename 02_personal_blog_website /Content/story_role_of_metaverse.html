        <h2>Crypto and <em>Metaverse</em> - A Match Made in Heaven?</h2>
        <p>
          From extended realities to crypto and web 3.0, several projects are shaping up to hasten significant shifts in
          human interaction on the internet. And recently, <em>Metaverse</em> talks have surged to the forefront, with
          more
          narratives and ideas being churned out, and big moves made almost every other week.
          The promise of the metaverse, among many other things, is that it will provide an internet-enabled extended
          reality that will be device- and location-agnostic. Blockchain and crypto, among others, promise to reduce the
          cost of trust, bank the unbanked, and redefine digital ownership. A potential mix between crypto and metaverse
          looks more appealing, let's briefly look at some exciting prospects.
        </p>
        <h2>The Crypto <em>Metaverse</em> - Financialization</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing that comes to mind in this merger is financialization. Crypto helps with financializing assets
          in three ways— identity, digital ownership, and trade. <br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>1. Identity </u></strong><br>
          The <em>Metaverse</em> will likely be an interplay of extended realities and a touch of web3, and of course, a
          valid
          identification will be needed. Now, it's unlikely that users will still subscribe to long, tiresome
          know-your-customer processes or side with a decentralized system where users' identities will be tied to a
          public address just like decentralized crypto wallets. Your crypto wallets are not only helpful in keeping
          your tokens; they can also be used to keep digital products like your avatars, clothings, accessories, weapons
          etc. You can decide to keep them in your wallet as a store of value or use them in other interoperable
          <em>Metaverse</em>. <br>
          <br>
        <div>
          <blockquote cite="#">
            <p>Blockchain and crypto, among others, promise to reduce the
              cost of trust, bank the unbanked, and redefine digital ownership."</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong><u>2. Trade </u></strong><br>
          Trade is fundamental to human nature, and it is essential to scale from the economic rent system riddling the
          current financial landscape if we're going to get anywhere. Stablecoins are an ideal fit for value exchange in
          the <em>Metaverse</em>. By leveraging the borderlessness of crypto on the stability of fiat, buying and
          selling assets
          becomes seamless. And, of course, existing crypto marketplaces would foster sales of virtual lands and
          properties, especially cross-chain marketplaces like AirNFTs. <br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>3. Digital ownership </u></strong><br>
          By now, everyone should probably know that the concept of digital ownership is changing thanks to NFTs. Assets
          in the <em>Metaverse</em> will be well suited as NFTs as users can then secure immutable, publicly verifiable
          rights to
          use them and trade in marketplaces. <br>
