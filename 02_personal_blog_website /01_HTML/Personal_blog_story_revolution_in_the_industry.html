          Non-fungible tokens or NFTs have been appearing in the news since late last year for mind-blowing reasons:
          Grimes selling digital art pieces for up to $6 million, Jack selling his first-ever tweet, and the Beeple NFT
          that sold for about $6.6 million. The market has raged on, with over 1198% increase in total market cap from
          last year and more celebrities auctioning their flagship NFTs to fans. <br>
          <br>
          Regardless of the inflated expectations surrounding the space, it is crucial to understand the potential
          drawbacks to full adoption. This article briefly highlights the NFTs, the existing NFT marketplaces and their
          shortfalls, and why AirNFTs — an upcoming marketplace — is an ideal fit
        </p>
        <h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
        <p>
          Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are proofs of ownership of digital items on a blockchain. They represent anything
          — art pieces, game collectibles, trophies, tweets, screenshots, meme, GIFs, or even this article. They are, by
          nature, non-interchangeable, and their worth is purely subjective, as opposed to fungible assets like the US
          Dollar or cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.
        </p>
        <h2>Why are NFTs Important?</h2>
        <p>
          NFTs’ ability to confer uniqueness to anything in the most secure way makes it a golden extension of the
          creator economy, taking it up by multiple notches. With NFTs, digital artworks now have real value, all
          verifiable on a blockchain.<br>
          <br>
          It doesn’t take a leap of faith to see where the NFT space is headed considering how much mainstream adoption
          that blockchain — the underpinning — tech is getting.

        <h2>On NFT Marketplaces</h2>
        <p>
          NFT marketplaces are blockchain-based markets where NFTs are bought, sold or auctioned.<br>
          <br>
          As with any other asset, liquidity necessitates a marketplace. This is why NFT marketplaces have sprung up
          almost in equal proportions to the NFT boom. Below are the ideal qualities to look out for in marketplaces,
          some of which are absent in the existing ones. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Speed</strong><br>
          Transactions on an ideal NFT marketplace should be fast. Activities taking minutes or even hours to complete
          makes for a disappointing experience for users. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cost</strong><br>
          Transaction fees should be meagre. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>User experience</strong><br>
          To fast-track adoption, marketplaces should be simple and easy to use.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Community</strong><br>
          Active communities increase liquidity; thus, NFT DApps and marketplaces must have a large and active
          user-base. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Governance</strong><br>
          The ideal governance setting is a decentralized structure where all holders of a platform’s native utility
          token have a right to vote and make decisions.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to setting up the ideal NFT marketplace, the platform plans to: <br>
          <br>
        <ul id="listtext">
          <li>Release AirNFT token— the native utility token used to incentivize users, for airdrops and with which
            holders will be able to suggest and vote on plans to move the project forward</li>
          <li>Support digital creators with NFT launchpads</li>
          <li>Build Auction where users can bid between each other</li>
          <li>Introduce royalties which enable creators to get a cut on secondary sales of their NFTs</li>
          <li>And bridge the BSC network with Ethereum 2.0, making it a one-stop cross-chain hub for all collectible
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>The Take-Away</h2>
        <p>
          NFTs have real potential to transform the digital creative world entirely, and AirNFTs will undoubtedly change
          how we perceive the idea of digital arts marketplace.
