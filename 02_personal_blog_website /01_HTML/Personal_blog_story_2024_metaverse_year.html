          This year, the metaverse has been the poster word of most tech and crypto websites. Tech analysts have been
          theorizing the next iteration of the internet, an idea where users get to interact and live many lives (with
          avatars) in a non-physical world. This abstract term, often traced to a dystopian novel in the early ’90s, has
          become the highlight of the tech industry discourse, thanks to big institutional moves, including the Facebook
          rebrand and Roblox’s initial public offering. <br>
          <br>
          Of course, every frontier in tech offers opportunities to propel humanity forward and ultimately make lives
          easier. But, on the flip side, solutions must be critically examined, and from the investor’s perspective, the
          prospect is what matters, and this piece briefly looks at the potential outlook for the metaverse in 2024.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the Metaverse?</h2>
        <p>
          Defining the metaverse is quite complicated, since it doesn’t exist yet. In attempts to narrow things down,
          people tend to conflate the metaverse with existing immersive tech such as virtual reality (VR), augmented
          reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR). VR headsets have been with us for a while, and, of course, we do love our
          Oculus Quest 2, which is now called Meta Quest 2, by the way. AR (think Snapchat’s dogs and Niantic’s Pokémon
          Go) has also taken off, and we see more utilities with MR. These technologies extend reality by immersing
          users in a digital environment with applications in numerous domains. <br>
          <br>
          While the metaverse will likely interplay these technologies, analysts believe the metaverse will offer a lot
          more with internet-enabled real-time 3D software and apps. Users will interact using avatars, play games,
          acquire lands and properties, and trade in shared virtual worlds. What’s more, the metaverse will be accessed
          on all devices and is location-independent. As a result, anybody with an internet-enabled device will be able
          to live a virtual life seamlessly.

        <h2>The Race to the Metaverse in 2024: Developments and Investments</h2>
        <p>
          As with any new frontier, there is usually a lot of buzz in the air. The metaverse is currently at the heart
          of its hype cycle, as evidenced by investments and the acquisition of human talents. <br>
          <br>
          Investments are key to the growth of any sector, and we are seeing some groundwork in acquisitions and
          fundings already. For example, Microsoft recently bought Activision, the gaming company, in a $68.7 billion
          deal. The purchase gives them IP rights to notable games, including Minecraft and Call of Duty. Grand Theft
          Automakers also recently announced that they acquired FarmVille maker– Zynga in a $13 billion deal. Key VCs
          recognize potentials as well. SoftBank, for example, invested up to $150 million in a South Korean metaverse
          company recently. <br>
          <br>
          Big techs like Meta and Microsoft are working overtime to get ahead of the curve and snatch that first-mover
          advantage. Aside from Facebook’s complete rebranding to The Meta Inc, chipmaker Nvidia has also launched
          Omniverse— a metaverse project to allow creators to simulate projects in an online platform. One of their
          participants is BMW, the automobile company. Crypto-native projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox are
          also setting sights on metaverse dominance as they keep introducing more features in their virtual worlds.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is clear that more people now see the metaverse as the next evolution of the internet— one that will
          probably pivot a much bigger shift in human interaction and behavior than the dot-com web.
