				lakes
				underlying what is now Mexico City,</p>

				<li><span>Threats</span>: Pollution, and invasive species. </li>
			</ul>
			<!-- your favorite animal's description goes here -->
			<p>The species is named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xolotl">Aztec deity Xolotl</a>, the god of fire and lightning, who transformed himself
				into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed by fellow gods. They continue to play an outsized cultural
				role in Mexico. <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/mudkip"">The Pokémon Mudkip</a> and its evolutions, added in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire (2002), take
				some visual inspiration from axolotls. Additionally, the Pokemon Wooper, added in Pokémon Gold,
				Silver and Crystal (1999), is directly based on an axolotl.
				As of 2020, the axolotl was near extinction due to urbanization in Mexico City and consequent
				water pollution,
